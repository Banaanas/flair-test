***** NOTES *****


1 - CSS Variables

2 - No design system - Hat to extract all design style by myself (colors, font-size, etc)

3 - No use of Flexbox Layout or Group in Figma. It would be really great for properties like padding, margin, and space between components.

4 - No use of 8pt Grid

5 - My typing could be optimized but not so much time

6 - I've been trying to make it stick to the design but if you want me to adapt it to my criteria, please ask
    By criteria, I mean Design good practices like the one I speak about above
    I've realized that the template did not follow some Design rules which could be interesting to work with.

    That's why you'll find some weird min-height or min-width properties, like 390px

  7 - Everything is dynamic. So there is no fixed height/width, but min/max height/width.
      It's important to keep in mind that screen sizes are multiples and that text size can
      change in function of the translation

  8 - It's responsive and semantic HTML

  9 - I've used the exact same Icons you use (mostly SVG files that I converted into React Components, to make them adaptables)


7 - Padding and Margin were not systemized (cf. 3)

8 - I decided to use / to not use some properties because of their supports (CanIUse)


9 - Permit me to warn you that some tags of your site are not well semantically design
    For example, on https://flair.hr/en/blog, button should be wrapped inside the button tag and not a div

10 - Some groups on Figma are incoherent

11 - Because elements are not organized by groups, as it should be in CSS, it's
difficult to define margins, padding between those (inexistant) groups and their parents

12 - All Tree elements for 1440px

TODO :
